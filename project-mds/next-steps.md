# Next Steps (Jan 22, 2026)

## Where we are (per `project-mds/main-spec.md`)

### Phase 1: UI Foundation + Testing Harness
- [x] Changelog-style dashboard feed (timeline task feed)
- [x] Task history view (filters + table)
- [x] Settings page shell (cloud execution language)
- [x] Mock data layer for UI development
- [ ] Component tests (Vitest + Testing Library)
- [ ] E2E test scaffolding (Playwright)
- [ ] UI/UX polish (in progress)

### Phase 2: Onboarding + Auth
- Not started

### Phase 3: Core API + Task Model
- In progress (basic task API used in UI)

### Phase 4+: Modal Execution

## Tomorrow (target ~1 hour)

### UI fixes
- Professionalize all buttons, font classes, and details across pages/components.
- Tighten timeline node + line visuals (clean, intentional, minimal effects).
- Refine failed/running/queued states for clarity.

### Phase alignment
- Keep iterating Phase 1 polish before starting tests.
- Identify any missing Phase 1 UI items (task detail view, empty states).

## Notes

- Cloud-native only: remove any local/daemon wording going forward.

## Summary (Latest)

- History smart search, table header cleanup, and export placement polish.
- Agent configuration quick mode styling for dashboard modal.
- Continued UI refinements across cards, inputs, and status cues.
